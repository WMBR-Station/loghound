<para bulletIndent=10 leading=12 leftIndent=25 spaceBefore=6 spaceAfter=12 rightIndent=10 fontSize=12><bullet><seq id='rulenum'/>.</bullet>If the Tower Lights are observed to be off when they should be on (when it is dark out), you must call the Logan Airport Tower (FAA) at 617-561-1919 and tell them.  WMBR’s tower is located at 60 Wadsworth St. in Cambridge.  The coordinates of the tower are 42 degrees 21’ 42.0” North Latitude, and 71 degrees 5’ 3.0” West Longitude.  The top of the tower is 357 feet (109 meters) above ground level, and 367 feet (112 meters) above sea level.  The FCC Tower Registration Number is 1007726.  Get the name of the FAA person who took the call.  Write this person’s name in the log, along with the time, date, and the words, “Tower Light Failure”.  Someone from the Emergency Technical Staff should then be contacted immediately.</para>
<para bulletIndent=10 leading=12 leftIndent=25 spaceBefore=6 spaceAfter=12 rightIndent=10 fontSize=12><bullet><seq id='rulenum'/>.</bullet>WMBR measures its power via the “direct” method.  To calculate the forward power via the “indirect method”, multiply the PA voltage times the PA current times 0.66 (our Power Effeciency Factor).  Divide this number by 240 watts (our nominal transmitter power) to get a percentage.</para>

All corrections, including those made at a later date, must be initialed by the original engineer who was signed in at the time.  Old logs are kept in the file cabinet for a minimum of two years.  If you are advised that you made a log entry mistake, please correct it as soon as possible.</para>
