## All OSes
You first need to install python-2.7 and pip. If you're missing either of these programs,
you will not be able to execute the setup script.

after installing pip, you need to install pyapp

	pip install pyapp

To compile the project, type 
	
	make

## On OSX

If you're compiling on OSX (especially Mavericks), you need to install python through brew:

	brew install python

This should also install pip. You can test this by typing `pip --help` into the terminal.

	pip --help
